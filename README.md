## Project Overview
The Wants+Needs App is a very simplistic approach to creating and saving your information. Think of something you want? Open the app, create a new "Want", attach an image or link if you want, and press "Add". It is as easy as that. Think of something you need? You already know the process now!

### Key Features
- **Adding Items**: From the Want or Need screens, press the "+" button to create a new one.
- **Deleting Items**: Simply slide an item in the list to the left, and you will be prompted with a deletion button.
- **Media Attachments**: You can easily attach an image (and links soon) to an item and store it for viewing later.
- **Additional Info**: More info than can be stored in the title can be put lower down on the item view. Details such as price, time, and other.

With its simple design, the Wants+Needs App not only makes it easy to store your wants and needs and prevent forgetting them, but you are also placed in a very nice app environment with lots of customization.
